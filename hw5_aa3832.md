# Loading the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

# Problem 1

## Summarizing the data to create two new columns for total murders and unsolved murders.

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

## Performing a prop.test for one city.

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>%
    pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% 
    pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

## Now will iterate to the remaining cities.

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

## Plotting results

``` r
homicide_plot = results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Unsolved Homicides in American Cities")
```

## Problem 1 - Describing the data

These homicide data are obtained from an investigative report published
in the Washington Post on homicides in 50 American cities. The article
focuses on the cities where murders appear to go unsolved. There are a
total of 52178 rows in this dataset. From these data and the
accompanying plot titled “Unsolved Homicides in American Cities” we can
appreciate that the probability of a homicide going unsolved is highest
in Chigago, IL with an estimated 0.73 probability of a murder going
unsolved.

# Problem 2

## Importing one data set

``` r
data_1 = read_csv("lda_data/con_01.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   week_1 = col_double(),
    ##   week_2 = col_double(),
    ##   week_3 = col_double(),
    ##   week_4 = col_double(),
    ##   week_5 = col_double(),
    ##   week_6 = col_double(),
    ##   week_7 = col_double(),
    ##   week_8 = col_double()
    ## )

## Iterating to importing the remaining data…

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("lda_data")) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/", path))

read_csv(path_df$path[[1]])
```

    ##   week_5 = col_double(),
    ##   week_6 = col_double(),
    ##   week_7 = col_double(),
    ##   week_8 = col_double()
    ## )

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8

    ## 1    0.2  -1.31   0.66   1.96   0.23   1.09   0.05   1.94

## Iterating to add the remaining data

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("lda_data")) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/", path),
    data = map(path_df$path, read_csv))

Checking now to see if this works…

``` r
path_df$data[[1]]
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   week_1 week_2 week_3 week_4 week_5 week_6 week_7 week_8
    ##    <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>
    ## 1    0.2  -1.31   0.66   1.96   0.23   1.09   0.05   1.94

Nice, ok yes it does\!

## Data wrangling, and tidying that involves separating a few variables and selecting columns and then unnesting. Tried to delete with str\_sub but kept getting a strange error.

``` r
path_df =
  path_df %>% 
  separate(path, into = c("lda_data", "study_arm"), sep = "/") %>% 
  separate(study_arm, into = c("study_arm", "samp"), sep = "_") %>% 
  separate(samp, into = c("subject", "csv", sep = ".")) %>% 
  select(!c(lda_data, csv, .)) %>% 
  mutate(
    subject = as.numeric(subject),
    study_arm = as.factor(study_arm)) %>% 
  group_by(study_arm) %>% 
  unnest(data)
```

    ## Warning: Expected 3 pieces. Missing pieces filled with `NA` in 20 rows [1, 2, 3,
    ## 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].

Now to create the spaghetti plot, I think we’ll have to pivot longer.

``` r
path_df =
  path_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(week_1:week_8, 
      names_to = "week", 
      values_to = "observation",
      names_prefix = "week_") %>% 
  mutate(
    week = as.numeric(week))
```

And now graph it.

``` r
path_plot = 
  path_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, group = subject)) +
    geom_line() + 
    facet_grid(. ~ study_arm) +  
    stat_smooth(aes(group = 1), method = "lm", se = TRUE) +
  labs(
    title = "Observations Over Time")
```

## Problem 2 Discussion

This dataset from 20 subjects from two groups, control and experimental,
and taken across 8 week timepoints reflects numeric the researcher’s
observations. From these data, we can appreciate that over the course of
8 weeks, the observations in the experimental arm increased while those
in the control arm decreased slightly.
